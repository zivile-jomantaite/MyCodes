# MyCodes
Here I upload the codes I create while studying Data Analytics

About Final_project.ipynb:
  For my final project of Data Analytics course at Vilnius Coding School, I chose to combine what I learned in SQL and Python classes. 
 
  Here you can see the analysis of New York Shootings in 9 different graphs: the first 6 graphs (sections: #1,#2,#3) portray the profiles of perpetrator and victim, 
  while the #4 section shows the hourly spread of the shootings in all New York. The last two graphs (section #5 and #5a), however, dive even deeper, revealing the
  prevelence of shootings in each of the NY districts in actual (#5) and in scaled numbers (#5a) for a better comparison and for a possible pattern reveal.
